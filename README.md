# What is going to happen

I am planning to build a 'Snake' game.

This is a classic game where the user controls a snake around the screen, consuming food to grow longer.

The objective of the game will be to eat / collect as much food as possible, while avoiding head-on collisions with the walls or the snakes own body. The challenge of the game increases as the snakes body grows longer, as it consumes more food, leaving less room to maneuver.

The score will increase with every piece of food eaten / consumed. There will be a max score when the snake reaches its maximum length and no more food can be placed on the screen.

There will be 3 difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard. Each will be differentiated by the speed the snake moves on the screen.

# How I plan on building it

# HTML/CSS

-[] A display of a fixed size for onscreen elements (snake & food)
-[] A set of buttons
-[] Direction buttons (up, down, left, right)
-[] Button to restart the game

-   -[] A score counter
    -[] A drop down menu to select the difficulty before the game starts.
